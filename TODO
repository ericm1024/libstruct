tests:
	The current testing is pretty good, but in general I think everything
	could use a few more tests that try as hard as they can to break the
	testee.

bugs:
	hash table implementation does not shrink when it can.
	linked list is failing a test.

in progress:
	btree
        red-black tree
	
future structures:
	vetor
	skip list
	string
	heap
	counting filter

housekeeping:
	- move all the types from libstruct.h to their respective header
	  files, that was a mistake to begin with
	- give comprehensive doccumentation of each interface and important
	  implementation details at top of header files. Functions are
	  individually well documented, but the 'big picture' is missing
	  in most if not all headers.
	- clean up make files, put variables in top level make file, use
	  seperate build directory
	- write a make target that actually compiles the code as a shared
	  library (i.e. make the damn thing usable)
