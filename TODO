tests:
	The current testing is pretty good, but in general I think everything
	could use a few more tests that try as hard as they can to break the
	testee.

bugs:
	hash table implementation does not shrink when it can.
	linked list is failing a test

unfinished structures:
	btree

future structures:
        red-black tree
	vetor
	skip list
	string
	heap
