libstruct, a data structure library for C/POSIX

In its current state, this library is not ready for real use. It needs
some further testing and optimization, the doccumentation needs to be
cleaned up, and a few more structures need to be added.

That being said, the current test suite has fairly good coverage, and
most data structures are complete with all tests passing.
